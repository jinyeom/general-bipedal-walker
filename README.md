# General Bipedal Walker

This repo contains a heavily modified version of [BipedalWalker-v2](https://gym.openai.com/envs/BipedalWalker-v2/) created by [Oleg Klimov](https://github.com/olegklimov). The goals of this project include:
- We want to provide a more comprehensive codebase for the environment, so that it's easier to work with in any future projects.
- We want to create a fairly general bipedal walker environment for different configurations, which can be used as a benchmark problem for meta reinforcement learning algorithms.
